## Description :house:

ABnB is the first step towards building my first full web application: the AirBnB clone. 

The project currently implements 
* Create a new object (ex: a new User or a new Place)
* Retrieve an object from a file, a database etc…
* Do operations on objects (count, compute stats, etc…)
* Update attributes of an object
* Destroy an object

## Classes :cl:

ABnB utilizes the following classes:

|     | BaseModel | FileStorage | User | State | City | Amenity | Place | Review |
| --- | --------- | ----------- | -----| ----- | -----| ------- | ----- | ------ |
| **PUBLIC INSTANCE ATTRIBUTES** | `id`<br>`created_at`<br>`updated_at` | | Inherits from `BaseModel` | Inherits from `BaseModel` | Inherits from `BaseModel` | Inherits from `BaseModel` | Inherits from `BaseModel` | Inherits from `BaseModel` |
| **PUBLIC INSTANCE METHODS** | `save`<br>`to_dict` | `all`<br>`new`<br>`save`<br>`reload` | "" | "" | "" | "" | "" | "" |
| **PUBLIC CLASS ATTRIBUTES** | | | `email`<br>`password`<br>`first_name`<br>`last_name`| `name` | `state_id`<br>`name` | `name` | `city_id`<br>`user_id`<br>`name`<br>`description`<br>`number_rooms`<br>`number_bathrooms`<br>`max_guest`<br>`price_by_night`<br>`latitude`<br>`longitude`<br>`amenity_ids` | `place_id`<br>`user_id`<br>`text` | 
| **PRIVATE CLASS ATTRIBUTES** | | `file_path`<br>`objects` | | | | | | |

## Storage :baggage_claim:

The above classes are handled by the abstracted storage engine defined in the 
[FileStorage](./models/engine/file_storage.py) class.

Every time the backend is initialized, ABnB instantiates an instance of 
`FileStorage` called `storage`. The `storage` object is loaded/re-loaded from 
any class instances stored in the JSON file `file.json`. As class instances are 
created, updated, or deleted, the `storage` object is used to register 
corresponding changes in the `file.json`.

## Console :computer:

The console is a command line interpreter that permits management of the backend 
of ABnB. It can be used to handle and manipulate all classes utilized by 
the application (achieved by calls on the `storage` object defined above).

### Using the Console

The ABnB console can be run both interactively and non-interactively. 
To run the console in non-interactive mode, pipe any command(s) into an execution 
of the file `console.py` at the command line.

```
$ echo "help" | ./console.py
(hbnb) 
Documented commands (type help <topic>):
========================================
EOF  all  count  create  destroy  show  update  help  quit

(hbnb) 
$
```

Alternatively, to use the ABnB console in interactive mode, run the 
file `console.py`:

```
$ ./console.py
```

To quit the console, enter the command `quit`, or input an EOF signal 
(`ctrl-D`).

```
$ ./console.py
(hbnb) quit
$
```

```
$ ./console.py
(hbnb) EOF
$
```


## Testing :straight_ruler:

Unittests for the ABnB project are defined in the [tests](./tests) 
folder. To run the entire test suite simultaneously, execute the following command:

```
$ python3 unittest -m discover tests
```

Alternatively, you can specify a single test file to run at a time:

```
$ python3 unittest -m tests/test_console.py
```
